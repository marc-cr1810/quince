//! What a type is, in the answer the inference pass gives.
//!
//! [`Type`] has three states and not two: `Unknown` is a real answer, and most
//! of a dynamically typed program is `Unknown`. The rest of this file is the
//! lookups that turn a builtin table into a type — what a native returns, what a
//! conversion produces, what an operator on two builtins answers with.
//!
//! **This is the file v0.7 rewrites.** `Type::Class(String)` cannot express
//! `list[int]`, so giving it arguments is that milestone's tranche 2, and it is
//! the item everything in v0.7 through v0.10 waits on. The matching table in
//! v0.7 §4.1 — which annotation holds which values, `float` widening an `int`,
//! containers matching invariantly — belongs beside [`Type`] here, and so do
//! v0.9's bounds and v0.7's alias substitution.
